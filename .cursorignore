# Cursor Ignore File - Token Usage Optimization
# 
# This file excludes large data files and historical documentation from AI context
# to reduce token usage while preserving code quality.
#
# IMPORTANT: Excluded files can still be referenced explicitly when needed.
# For example: "Look at inventory_items.csv" will still work - the AI can read
# the file on demand, it just won't be automatically included in every context.

# ============================================================================
# DATA FILES - Exclude large CSV data files (not code)
# ============================================================================
# These files contain warehouse data (thousands of rows), not code logic.
# For code questions, AI needs the parser code (CSVParser.ts) and schema docs
# (DataContracts.md), not the actual data rows.
# 
# Schema documentation is kept in docs/DataContracts.md (included)
# Parser code is kept in src/data/parsers/CSVParser.ts (included)
# Usage examples are kept in src/services/DataService.ts (included)

*.csv
public/datasets/**/*.csv

# Optional: Exclude JSON data files if they become large
# Currently small (~1-4KB each), but future-proof
# Uncomment if JSON data files grow large:
# public/data/**/*.json

# ============================================================================
# BUILD ARTIFACTS - Exclude generated files
# ============================================================================
# These are build outputs and dependencies, not source code

dist/
dist-ssr/
node_modules/
*.log
*.cache

# ============================================================================
# HISTORICAL DOCUMENTATION - Exclude implementation summaries
# ============================================================================
# These are historical records of completed work, not active code documentation.
# Core architecture docs in docs/ remain included for active development.

*_SUMMARY.md
*_COMPLETE.md
*_TESTING.md
*_FIX_SUMMARY.md
*_UPDATE.md

# ============================================================================
# KEEP INCLUDED (explicitly NOT excluded)
# ============================================================================
# The following remain accessible to AI:
# - All source code: src/**/*.ts, src/**/*.tsx
# - All config files: package.json, tsconfig.json, vite.config.ts, etc.
# - Core documentation: docs/*.md (Architecture.md, PRD.md, DataContracts.md, etc.)
# - README.md and essential project files
# - All JSON config files (not data files)
